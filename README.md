The concept of version control and git was a little bit hard to understand at first but then it started to get clearer throughout the process of doing the excercise. I’ve learnt that git is used to track changes in files, and GitHub allows multiple people to work on a project without overwriting each other’s work.
I have no problem in doing number 1 (initializing and cloning a repository from GitHub to local device), it was pretty straighforward and easy to follow. However, when moving on to the next steps, it got a little harder because i had to work with both local and remote repositories. Also sometimes I forgot to stage files before commiting them, which made the process take longer. I also found branches a little confusing. At times, I wasn’t sure which branch I was working on or where I needed to push my local commits.
For number 3, i don’t know if I have to merge the “dev” branch to the “main” branch or not so I just stopped at opening a pull request and didn’t merge it yet. 
Since I’m not used to coding, this was quite challenging for me, and it took a lot of time to complete the tasks. However, it helped me to understand the concept of Git and GitHub, and to get used to coding.
But I don't know which branch should I upload the note so I'm commiting file on both branches.
